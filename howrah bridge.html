    <h1>Howrah Bridge</h1>
    <p>
        The Howrah Bridge is a balanced cantilever bridge over the Hooghly River in West Bengal, India. Commissioned in
        1943,[9][11] the bridge was originally named the New Howrah Bridge, because it replaced a pontoon bridge at the
        same location linking the cities of Howrah and Kolkata (Calcutta). On 14 June 1965, it was renamed Rabindra Setu
        after the great Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was the first Indian and Asian Nobel laureate.[11] It is
        still popularly known as the Howrah Bridge.

        The bridge is one of four on the Hooghly River and is a famous symbol of Kolkata and West Bengal. The other
        bridges are the Vidyasagar Setu (popularly called the Second Hooghly Bridge), the Vivekananda Setu and the
        relatively new Nivedita Setu. It carries a daily traffic of approximately 100,000 vehicles[12] and possibly more
        than 150,000 pedestrians,[10] easily making it the busiest cantilever bridge in the world.[13] The third-longest
        cantilever bridge at the time of its construction,[14] the Howrah Bridge is currently the sixth-longest bridge
        of its type in the world.[15]
