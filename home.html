    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr/>
   <p> NIIT was established in 1981 by Rajendra S. Pawar and Vijay K. Thadani, graduates from IIT[5] Delhi, with one million rupees. NIIT conceived a franchising model in IT education for the very first time, setting up nine centers by 1987.
</p><p>
In 1986, NIIT began its foray into the software domain, beginning with Software Product Distribution under the 'Insoft' brand.[6] The company also began offering advice and consultancy to large corporations on how to leverage technology and make optimum use of their IT investments.
</p><p>
In 1988, NIIT introduced many marketing and advertising strategies for the Indian market including the 'Computer drome' in 1990.[7] Another initiative launched by NIIT, was its Bhavishya Jyoti Scholarships program, launched in 1991,[8] which was targeted at deserving and socially challenged students with an aim to improve their skills and employability quotient.
</p><p>
In 1992, NIIT launched its flagship program GNIIT, an industry-endorsed course with a 12-month Professional Practice for students seeking careers in the IT and non-IT sectors. By 1993, the NIIT stock began trading on Indian stock exchanges. In 1996, NIIT began its globalization journey, setting up an education center in Hong Kong. In the same year, the company launched its virtual university 'NetVarsity'. In 1998, NIIT joined a handful of Indian tech companies to enter the Chinese market.
</p><p>
The company earned the epithet, the 'McDonald's of the software business' by Far Eastern Economic Review in September, 2001.[9] The same year, NIIT launched an experiment that was christened 'Hole-in-the-Wall' by media and drew international attention. The experiment was based on the ‘minimally invasive education’ methodology developed by NIIT R&D. It suggested that children, irrespective of their social, ethnic, or educational identity could learn to use computers by themselves, without adult intervention. In 2003, NIIT launched its MindChampions Academy (MCA) with Viswanathan Anand, five-time former World Chess champion and NIIT Brand Ambassador.
</p><p>
In 2004, NIIT sectioned off its software business into an independent organization called NIIT Technologies Ltd. (Source: NASSCOM's 2013–14 Ranking of Top 20 IT services companies). In the area of training, NIIT launched its 'Edgeineers' program in 2005, to boost career opportunities for engineering graduates. In 2006, it diversified into various new sectors for training, such as banking, finance and insurance (through IFBI), executive management education (through NIIT Imperia brand), Professional Life Skills training and business process management training (through Evolv and NIIT Uniqua).
</p><p>
In 2009, NIIT University (NU), a not-for-profit University was established, under section 2(f) of UGC Act and notified by the Government of Rajasthan.
</p><p>
In 2014, NIIT tied up with National Skill Development Corporation to launch NIIT Yuva Jyoti centers, under the pilot phase of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Skill India campaign and the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) in North East, J&K and Jharkhand.[10]
</p><p>
In May 2019, Baring Private Equity Asia had acquired controlling stake of NIIT Ltd in NIIT Technologies Ltd.
</p><p>
In August 2020, NIIT Technologies Ltd. rebranded itself and began operating under the name Coforge Limited. [11]
