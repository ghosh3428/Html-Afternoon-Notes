    <h1> KOLKATA</h1>
    <p> Kolkata (English: /kɒlˈkɑːtə/[15] or /kɒlˈkʌtə/,[16] Bengali: [kolˈkata] (listen); also known as Calcutta
        /kælˈkʌtə/,[16] the official name until 2001) is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal. Located on the
        eastern bank of the Hooghly River, the city is approximately 80 km (50 mi) west of the border with Bangladesh.
        It is the primary business, commercial, and financial hub of Eastern India and the main port of communication
        for North-East India.[17] According to the 2011 Indian census, Kolkata is the seventh-most populous city in
        India, with a population of 45 lakh (4.5 million) residents within the city limits, and a population of over
        1.41 crore (14.1 million) residents in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area. It is the third-most populous metropolitan
        area in India. In 2021, the Kolkata metropolitan area crossed 1.5 crore (15 million) registered voters. The Port
        of Kolkata is India's oldest operating port and its sole major riverine port. Kolkata is regarded as the
        cultural capital of India. Kolkata is the second largest Bengali-speaking city after Dhaka. It has the highest
        number of nobel laureates among all cities in India.[1][18]

        In the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under
        Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690,[19] the area was
        developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post known as Fort William. Nawab Siraj
        ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following year. In 1793 the East
        India Company was strong enough to abolish native rule, and assumed full sovereignty of the region. Under
        company rule and later under the British Raj, Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in
        India until 1911. In that year, after assessing its geographical location, combined with growing nationalism in
        Bengal (Calcutta became the centre for the Indian independence movement), the British moved the capital to the
        relatively more centrally located New Delhi.

        Following independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the premier centre of Indian commerce, culture, and
        politics, suffered many decades of political violence and economic stagnation before it rebounded.[20] A
        demographically diverse global city, the culture of Kolkata features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively
        close-knit neighbourhoods (paras) and freestyle conversations (adda). Kolkata is home to eastern India's film
        industry, known as Tollywood, and cultural institutions, such as the Academy of Fine Arts, the Victoria
        Memorial, the Asiatic Society, the Indian Museum, and the National Library of India. Among scientific
        institutions, Kolkata hosts the Agri Horticultural Society of India, the Geological Survey of India, the
        Botanical Survey of India, the Calcutta Mathematical Society, the Indian Science Congress Association, the
        Zoological Survey of India, the Institution of Engineers, the Anthropological Survey of India and the Indian
        Public Health Association. Four Nobel laureates and two Nobel Memorial Prize winners are associated with the
        city.[21] Though home to major cricketing venues and franchises, Kolkata stands out in India for being the
        country's centre of association football and also having strong culture in other sports less widespread
        elsewhere.
